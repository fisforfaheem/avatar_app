# App Icon Replacement Instructions

The current app_icon.ico file is the default Flutter icon. To replace it with your custom Voice Avatar Hub icon:

1. Create an ICO file with the following dimensions:
   - 16x16
   - 32x32
   - 48x48
   - 256x256

2. Name it "app_icon.ico" and replace the existing file in this directory.

3. Rebuild the app to apply the changes.

Notes:
- You can use online ICO converters or tools like IconWorkshop to create ICO files from PNG images
- Make sure your ICO file includes all required resolutions for proper display at different sizes
- The MSIX package configured in pubspec.yaml expects the PNG icon at assets/app_icons/app_icon_256.png
